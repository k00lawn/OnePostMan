///////Jaabir //////

-----------  frontend  -----

need to be responsive 
logout button
fb revoke button
old schedule form is kinda responsive , copy that code to new form
after the scheduled form is posted , that form is not disappearing 
caption is disappearing after trying to edit the scheduled form 
its not redirecting to another page once the form is redirected ( in the editing schediuled form )
paste that awesome home page from stackblitz to the app
paste that awesome schedule form page from stackblitz to the app
if theres no scheduled post notify the user that no schedules to post 
user is able to post without even authing


--------- backend ---------


	--------- node js ---------

	logout option //fixed
	revoke fb option
	refactor the code - this is when the user aauth to tw ( there are lot of errors )	
	error after scheduling a post - Error: Must supply a value for form control with name: 'userId
	make the form to disappear after that form is posted 
	user is able to post without even authing ( validation )
	after trying to post with authing its  not posting again it to the db -  UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: ValidationError: Post validation failed: facebook: Cast to Boolean failed for value "null" at path "facebook" ( error in the node ) 
	
	cant able to auth to tw or fb after i tried to post to tw or fb without authing 

	after testing the above 3 , restarted the app both in web and node server , after authing to tw revoke button didnt show after authing 

	-------- python ----------
		

	change the page_details key name
	sometimes its not looping ( threading bug ) ( risky bug need to validate ASAP )
